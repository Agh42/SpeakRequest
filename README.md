# SpeakRequest

**A modern meeting manager for live and hybrid meetings**

SpeakRequest is a meeting manager designed for live and hybrid meetings. 

It helps moderators facilitate meetings by managing speak requests from participants, transparently showing who has the right to speak and for how long they've been talking. Each participant's place in the queue is visible at any moment.

The popout view can be placed by the facilitator on a projector or shared on-screen via web conferencing software such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or similar platforms. 

It also allows quick and hassle-free conduction of live polls with different poll types supported. Local participants can vote by scanning the QR code shown on the projector screen. Remote participants can easily join by entering the simple four-letter room code.
