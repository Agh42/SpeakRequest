# Room Limit Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a room limit of 500,000 to the SpeakRequest application. When the limit is reached and a new room needs to be created, the oldest room (determined by its meeting start timestamp) is automatically evicted.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

1. **RoomRepository.java** (within MeetingApp.java)
   - Added `MAX_ROOMS` constant set to 500,000
   - Modified `getOrCreate()` method to check room count before creating new rooms
   - Added `removeOldestRoom()` private method that:
     - Finds the room with the oldest `meetingStartSec` timestamp
     - Removes that room from `roomsByCode`
     - Cleans up all associated session tracking entries in `sessionToRoomCode`

### Key Features

- **Thread-Safe**: Uses `ConcurrentHashMap` for concurrent access
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Session tracking is automatically cleaned up when a room is evicted
- **Timestamp-Based**: Eviction is based on the room's `meetingStartSec` field, which is set when the room is created
- **Minimal Performance Impact**: Eviction only occurs when limit is reached

### Test Coverage

Three test classes were added to verify the implementation:

1. **RoomRepositoryTest.java**: Unit tests for basic repository functionality
   - Room creation and retrieval
   - Session tracking
   - Concurrent room creation
   - MAX_ROOMS constant verification

2. **RoomLimitIntegrationTest.java**: Integration tests for room limit behavior
   - Timestamp ordering verification
   - Session cleanup verification
   - Sequential room creation

3. **RoomLimitDemonstrationTest.java**: Demonstration tests showing actual eviction
   - Full eviction scenario with 500,000 rooms
   - Verification that oldest room is removed
   - Session cleanup verification

All 33 tests pass successfully.

## Behavior

### Normal Operation (< 500,000 rooms)
- Rooms are created normally
- All rooms are retained in memory
- No eviction occurs

### At Limit (= 500,000 rooms)
- When a new room would exceed the limit:
  1. The system finds the room with the oldest `meetingStartSec` timestamp
  2. That room is removed from the registry
  3. All session tracking entries for that room are cleaned up
  4. The new room is created
  5. Total room count remains at 500,000

## Example

```java
// Creating rooms normally
Room room1 = repository.getOrCreate("ABCD");  // meetingStartSec = 1000
Room room2 = repository.getOrCreate("EFGH");  // meetingStartSec = 1005
// ... 499,998 more rooms created ...

// When the 500,000th room exists and we try to create one more:
Room newRoom = repository.getOrCreate("WXYZ");
// Result:
// - room1 (oldest, meetingStartSec = 1000) is evicted
// - newRoom is created
// - Total rooms remains at 500,000
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory**: With 500,000 rooms, memory usage will be significant but bounded
- **Eviction Cost**: O(n) to find the oldest room when eviction is needed (only happens at limit)
- **Normal Operations**: No performance impact for room creation when below the limit
- **Concurrent Access**: Thread-safe operations using ConcurrentHashMap

## Future Improvements (Optional)

If needed for better performance at scale:
- Use a sorted data structure (e.g., TreeMap) to maintain rooms in timestamp order
- Implement periodic cleanup of inactive rooms
- Add metrics to track room evictions
- Consider LRU (Least Recently Used) instead of oldest timestamp
